'  Example Program:
'     SCANsingleBufAsync.FRM
' 
'  Description:
'     Read a waveform from two analog input channels using internal
'      timing (uses low-level NI-DAQ functions)
' 
'  Example Category:
'     AI
' 
'  Example Task Types:
'     BUF, NCH, BURST, ASYNC, INTTRIG
' 
'  List of key parameters:
'     iScanTB, uScanInt
' 
'     [Since variables are hardcoded, there is no guarantee that this
'      program will work for your setup.  This example is simply
'      presented as a code snippet of how you can use NI-DAQ functions
'      to perform a task.]
' 
'  List of NI-DAQ Functions used in this example:
'     DAQ_Rate, SCAN_Setup, NIDAQErrorHandler, SCAN_Start, DAQ_Check,
'      NIDAQYield, SCAN_Demux, DAQ_VScale, DAQ_Clear
' 
'     [NOTE: For further details on each NI-DAQ function, please refer
'      to the NI-DAQ On-Line Help (NIDAQPC.HLP).]
' 
'  Pin Connection Information: 
'     Connect your analog signals to AI channels 1 and 2. The default
'      analog input mode for the DAQ device will be used.
' 
'     [For further I/O connection details, please refer to your hardware
'      User Manual.]
' 
'     [For further details on how to run this example, please refer to
'      the NI-DAQ Examples On-Line Help (NIDAQEx.HLP).]
