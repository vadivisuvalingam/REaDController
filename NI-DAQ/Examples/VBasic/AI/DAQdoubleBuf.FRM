'  Example Program:
'     DAQdoubleBuf.FRM
' 
'  Description:
'     Read a waveform from one analog input channel continuously using
'      internal timing (uses low-level NI-DAQ functions)
' 
'  Example Category:
'     AI
' 
'  Example Task Types:
'     BUF, 1CH, CONT, INTTIM, ASYNC, INTTRIG
' 
'  List of key parameters:
'     iDBmodeON, ulCount, iSampTB, iHalfReady, lTimeout
' 
'     [Since variables are hardcoded, there is no guarantee that this
'      program will work for your setup.  This example is simply
'      presented as a code snippet of how you can use NI-DAQ functions
'      to perform a task.]
' 
'  List of NI-DAQ Functions used in this example:
'     Timeout_Config, NIDAQErrorHandler, DAQ_Rate, DAQ_DB_Config,
'      DAQ_Start, DAQ_DB_HalfReady, DAQ_DB_Transfer, NIDAQYield,
'      DAQ_Clear
' 
'     [NOTE: For further details on each NI-DAQ function, please refer
'      to the NI-DAQ On-Line Help (NIDAQPC.HLP).]
' 
'  Pin Connection Information: 
'     Connect your analog signal to AI channel 1. The default analog
'      input mode for the DAQ device will be used.
' 
'     [For further I/O connection details, please refer to your hardware
'      User Manual.]
' 
'     [For further details on how to run this example, please refer to
