/*********************************************************************
*
* Example program: 
*    WFMdoubleBuf.c
*
* Description: 
*    Continuously outputs a waveform from one analog output channel,
*     using internal timing (uses low-level NI-DAQ functions)
*
* Example Category: 
*    AO
*
* Example Task Types: 
*    BUF, 1CH, CONT, ASYNC, INTTIM, INTTRIG
*
* List of key parameters: 
*    iDBmodeON, iOldDataStop, iPartialTransferStop, ulIterations,
*     iWFMstopped
*
*    [Since variables are hardcoded, there is no guarantee that this
*     program will work for your setup.  This example is simply
*     presented as a code snippet of how you can use NI-DAQ functions
*     to perform a task.]
*
* List of NI-DAQ Functions used in this example: 
*    Timeout_Config, NIDAQErrorHandler, NIDAQMakeBuffer, WFM_DB_Config,
*     WFM_Group_Setup, WFM_Scale, WFM_Load, WFM_Rate, WFM_ClockRate,
*     WFM_Group_Control, WFM_DB_HalfReady, WFM_DB_Transfer, NIDAQYield,
*     WFM_Check, AO_VWrite
*
*    [NOTE: For further details on each NI-DAQ function, please refer
*     to the NI-DAQ On-Line Help (NIDAQPC.HLP).]
*
* Pin Connection Information: 
*    The analog output signal will be available at AO channel 0. The
*     default analog output mode for the DAQ device will be used.
*
*    [For further I/O connection details, please refer to your hardware
*     User Manual.]
