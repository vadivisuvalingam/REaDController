/*********************************************************************
*
* Example program: 
*    9513freqMeasure.c
*
* Description: 
*    Measures the frequency of a digital pulse train using counter 5
*     and a 1 second pulse generated from counter 1 (for devices with
*     the Am9513 counter/timer). See NOTE below about measuring
*     frequencies above 65535Hz.
*
* Example Category: 
*    CTR
*
* Example Task Types: 
*    FREQM, INTTIM
*
* List of key parameters: 
*    iCtr2, iGateMode2, iTimeBase1, iTimeBase2, uPulseWidth
*
*    [Since variables are hardcoded, there is no guarantee that this
*     program will work for your setup.  This example is simply
*     presented as a code snippet of how you can use NI-DAQ functions
*     to perform a task.]
*
* List of NI-DAQ Functions used in this example: 
*    CTR_Config, NIDAQErrorHandler, CTR_Period, CTR_Pulse, NIDAQDelay,
*     CTR_State, NIDAQYield, CTR_EvRead, CTR_Reset
*
*    [NOTE: For further details on each NI-DAQ function, please refer
*     to the NI-DAQ On-Line Help (NIDAQPC.HLP).]
*
* Pin Connection Information: 
*    Connect your digital pulse train to the SOURCE5 pin. Also, connect
*     OUT1 to GATE5. Connect the ground reference to the 'digital
*     ground' pin.
*
*    [For further I/O connection details, please refer to your hardware
*     User Manual.]
*
*    [For further details on how to run this example, please refer to
*     the NI-DAQ Examples On-Line Help (NIDAQEx.HLP).]
