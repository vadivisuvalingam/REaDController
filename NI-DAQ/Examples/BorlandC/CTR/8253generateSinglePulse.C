/*********************************************************************
*
* Example program: 
*    8253generateSinglePulse.c
*
* Description: 
*    Generates a single digital pulse from counter 0 (Mode 0, for
*     devices with the 8253 interval counter/timer)
*
* Example Category: 
*    CTR
*
* Example Task Types: 
*    PLSTRN
*
* List of key parameters: 
*    iCtr, iMode
*
*    [Since variables are hardcoded, there is no guarantee that this
*     program will work for your setup.  This example is simply
*     presented as a code snippet of how you can use NI-DAQ functions
*     to perform a task.]
*
* List of NI-DAQ Functions used in this example: 
*    ICTR_Setup, NIDAQErrorHandler, NIDAQDelay, ICTR_Reset
*
*    [NOTE: For further details on each NI-DAQ function, please refer
*     to the NI-DAQ On-Line Help (NIDAQPC.HLP).]
*
* Pin Connection Information: 
*    Your digital pulse (active LOW) will be on the OUT0 or OUTB0 pin.
*     Connect the ground reference to the 'digital ground' pin. You can
*     "gate" the pulse train off if you connect a digital logic LOW
*     signal to the GATE0 or GATB0 pin. NOTE: not all devices with the
*     8253 have a counter 0.
*
*    [For further I/O connection details, please refer to your hardware
*     User Manual.]
*
*    [For further details on how to run this example, please refer to
*     the NI-DAQ Examples On-Line Help (NIDAQEx.HLP).]
