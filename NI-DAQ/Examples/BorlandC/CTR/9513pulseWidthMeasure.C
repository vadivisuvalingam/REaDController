/*********************************************************************
*
* Example program: 
*    9513pulseWidthMeasure.c
*
* Description: 
*    Measures the width of a single digital pulse using counter 1 and a
*     1MHz internal timebase (for devices with the Am9513
*     counter/timer)
*
* Example Category: 
*    CTR
*
* Example Task Types: 
*    PLSWM, INTTIM
*
* List of key parameters: 
*    iCtr, iGateMode, iTimeBase
*
*    [Since variables are hardcoded, there is no guarantee that this
*     program will work for your setup.  This example is simply
*     presented as a code snippet of how you can use NI-DAQ functions
*     to perform a task.]
*
* List of NI-DAQ Functions used in this example: 
*    CTR_Config, NIDAQErrorHandler, CTR_Period, NIDAQDelay, CTR_EvRead,
*     CTR_Reset
*
*    [NOTE: For further details on each NI-DAQ function, please refer
*     to the NI-DAQ On-Line Help (NIDAQPC.HLP).]
*
* Pin Connection Information: 
*    Connect your digital pulse to the GATE1 pin. Connect the ground
*     reference to the 'digital ground' pin.
*
*    [For further I/O connection details, please refer to your hardware
*     User Manual.]
*
*    [For further details on how to run this example, please refer to
*     the NI-DAQ Examples On-Line Help (NIDAQEx.HLP).]
