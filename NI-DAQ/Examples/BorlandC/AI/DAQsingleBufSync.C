/*********************************************************************
*
* Example program: 
*    DAQsingleBufSync.c
*
* Description: 
*    Read a waveform from one analog input channel using internal
*     timing (uses high-level NI-DAQ functions)
*
* Example Category: 
*    AI
*
* Example Task Types: 
*    BUF, 1CH, BURST, SYNC, INTTRIG
*
* List of key parameters: 
*    lTimeout, dSampRate
*
*    [Since variables are hardcoded, there is no guarantee that this
*     program will work for your setup.  This example is simply
*     presented as a code snippet of how you can use NI-DAQ functions
*     to perform a task.]
*
* List of NI-DAQ Functions used in this example: 
*    Timeout_Config, NIDAQErrorHandler, DAQ_Op, DAQ_VScale
*
*    [NOTE: For further details on each NI-DAQ function, please refer
*     to the NI-DAQ On-Line Help (NIDAQPC.HLP).]
*
* Pin Connection Information: 
*    Connect your analog signal to AI channel 1. The default analog
*     input mode for the DAQ device will be used.
*
*    [For further I/O connection details, please refer to your hardware
*     User Manual.]
*
*    [For further details on how to run this example, please refer to
*     the NI-DAQ Examples On-Line Help (NIDAQEx.HLP).]
