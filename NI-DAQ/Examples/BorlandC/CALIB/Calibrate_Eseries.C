/*********************************************************************
*
* Example program: 
*    Calibrate_Eseries.c
*
* Description: 
*    Calibrate an E-series board using internal voltage reference
*     (SELF_CALIBRATE) and store calibration constants in
*     USER_EEPROM_AREA. (E-series only)  This example also takes
*     measurements over 50/60Hz sinewave periods and averages the data
*     before and after calibration, so you can compare.
*
* Example Category: 
*    CALIB
*
* Example Task Types: 
*    ESER, BUF, 1CH, SYNC, INTTIM
*
* List of key parameters: 
*    piBuffer, dSampRate, ulCalOp, ulSetOfCalConst
*
*    [Since variables are hardcoded, there is no guarantee that this
*     program will work for your setup.  This example is simply
*     presented as a code snippet of how you can use NI-DAQ functions
*     to perform a task.]
*
* List of NI-DAQ Functions used in this example: 
*    DAQ_Op, NIDAQErrorHandler, NIDAQMean, Calibrate_E_Series
*
*    [NOTE: For further details on each NI-DAQ function, please refer
*     to the NI-DAQ On-Line Help (NIDAQPC.HLP).]
*
* Pin Connection Information: 
*    Ground the inputs to AI channel 1.  If the device is in
*     differential mode, tie both the + and - inputs to AIGND. If the
*     device is in single-ended mode, tie the input to AIGND.
*
*    [For further I/O connection details, please refer to your hardware
*     User Manual.]
*
*    [For further details on how to run this example, please refer to
*     the NI-DAQ Examples On-Line Help (NIDAQEx.HLP).]
