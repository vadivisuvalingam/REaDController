/*********************************************************************
*
* Example program: 
*    DAQsingleBufAnalogTrig.c
*
* Description: 
*    Read a waveform from one analog input channel upon an rising-slope
*     analog trigger using internal timing (uses low-level NI-DAQ
*     functions, ONLY for E-series devices with analog triggering
*     support)
*
* Example Category: 
*    AI
*
* Example Task Types: 
*    BUF, 1CH, BURST, INTTIM, ASYNC, ATRIG
*
* List of key parameters: 
*    lLowValue, lHighValue, iSampTB
*
*    [Since variables are hardcoded, there is no guarantee that this
*     program will work for your setup.  This example is simply
*     presented as a code snippet of how you can use NI-DAQ functions
*     to perform a task.]
*
* List of NI-DAQ Functions used in this example: 
*    Configure_HW_Analog_Trigger, NIDAQErrorHandler, Select_Signal,
*     DAQ_Rate, DAQ_Start, DAQ_Check, NIDAQYield, DAQ_VScale, DAQ_Clear
*
*    [NOTE: For further details on each NI-DAQ function, please refer
*     to the NI-DAQ On-Line Help (NIDAQPC.HLP).]
*
* Pin Connection Information: 
*    Connect your analog signal to AI channel 1. Connect the ground
*     reference of the analog signal to AIGND. The signal you connect
*     will be the analog trigger signal. The default analog input mode
*     for the DAQ device will be used. NOTE... The analog trigger
*     source can also be set to PFI0, if you set the last parameter in
*     Config_HW_Analog_Trigger to ND_PFI_0.
*
*    [For further I/O connection details, please refer to your hardware
*     User Manual.]
*
*    [For further details on how to run this example, please refer to
*     the NI-DAQ Examples On-Line Help (NIDAQEx.HLP).]
