/*********************************************************************
*
* Example program: 
*    SCANsingleBufMultiRate.c
*
* Description: 
*    Read a waveform from three analog input channels at per-channel
*     scan rate divisors of 1:2:4:8 (uses low-level NI-DAQ functions)
*     NOTE: There are quite a few hardware limitations depending on
*     devices when using this example.  Refer to the description for
*     the SCAN_Sequence_Setup function for details.
*
* Example Category: 
*    AI
*
* Example Task Types: 
*    BUF, NCH, BURST, INTTIM, ASYNC, INTTRIG
*
* List of key parameters: 
*    lTimeout, dSampRate, dScanRate, piScanRateDivVect,
*     pulSampsPerChanVect
*
*    [Since variables are hardcoded, there is no guarantee that this
*     program will work for your setup.  This example is simply
*     presented as a code snippet of how you can use NI-DAQ functions
*     to perform a task.]
*
* List of NI-DAQ Functions used in this example: 
*    SCAN_Sequence_Setup, NIDAQErrorHandler, SCAN_Sequence_Retrieve,
*     DAQ_Rate, SCAN_Start, DAQ_Check, SCAN_Sequence_Demux, DAQ_VScale,
*     DAQ_Clear
*
*    [NOTE: For further details on each NI-DAQ function, please refer
*     to the NI-DAQ On-Line Help (NIDAQPC.HLP).]
*
* Pin Connection Information: 
*    Connect your analog signals to AI channels 1,2,3 and 4. The
*     default analog input mode for the DAQ device will be used.
*
*    [For further I/O connection details, please refer to your hardware
*     User Manual.]
*
*    [For further details on how to run this example, please refer to
*     the NI-DAQ Examples On-Line Help (NIDAQEx.HLP).]
