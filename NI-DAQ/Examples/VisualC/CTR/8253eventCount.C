/*********************************************************************
*
* Example program: 
*    8253eventCount.c
*
* Description: 
*    Counts the number of digital pulses (or events, Mode 0) going into
*     the clock input of counter 1, ten times (for devices with the
*     8253 interval counter/timer)
*
* Example Category: 
*    CTR
*
* Example Task Types: 
*    EVENTCNT
*
* List of key parameters: 
*    iCtr, iMode
*
*    [Since variables are hardcoded, there is no guarantee that this
*     program will work for your setup.  This example is simply
*     presented as a code snippet of how you can use NI-DAQ functions
*     to perform a task.]
*
* List of NI-DAQ Functions used in this example: 
*    ICTR_Setup, NIDAQErrorHandler, ICTR_Read, NIDAQDelay, NIDAQYield,
*     ICTR_Reset
*
*    [NOTE: For further details on each NI-DAQ function, please refer
*     to the NI-DAQ On-Line Help (NIDAQPC.HLP).]
*
* Pin Connection Information: 
*    Connect your digital pulse train to the CLK1 or CLKB1pin. Connect
*     the ground reference to the 'digital ground' pin. You can gate
*     the count if you connect a digital signal to GATE1 or GATB1.  A
*     logic 'low' would halt counting, and a logic 'high' would
*     continue counting.
*
*    [For further I/O connection details, please refer to your hardware
*     User Manual.]
*
*    [For further details on how to run this example, please refer to
*     the NI-DAQ Examples On-Line Help (NIDAQEx.HLP).]
