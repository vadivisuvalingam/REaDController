/*********************************************************************
*
* Example program: 
*    9513generateSinglePulse.c
*
* Description: 
*    Generates a single digital pulse 1 ms LOW and 100 ms HIGH using
*     counter 1 and an internal timebase (for devices with the Am9513
*     counter/timer)
*
* Example Category: 
*    CTR
*
* Example Task Types: 
*    PULSTRN, INTTIM
*
* List of key parameters: 
*    iOutType, iTimeBase, uDelay, uPulseWidth
*
*    [Since variables are hardcoded, there is no guarantee that this
*     program will work for your setup.  This example is simply
*     presented as a code snippet of how you can use NI-DAQ functions
*     to perform a task.]
*
* List of NI-DAQ Functions used in this example: 
*    CTR_Config, NIDAQErrorHandler, CTR_Pulse, NIDAQDelay, CTR_State,
*     NIDAQYield, CTR_Reset
*
*    [NOTE: For further details on each NI-DAQ function, please refer
*     to the NI-DAQ On-Line Help (NIDAQPC.HLP).]
*
* Pin Connection Information: 
*    Your digital pulse will be on the OUT1 pin. Connect the ground
*     reference to the 'digital ground' pin.
*
*    [For further I/O connection details, please refer to your hardware
*     User Manual.]
*
*    [For further details on how to run this example, please refer to
*     the NI-DAQ Examples On-Line Help (NIDAQEx.HLP).]
