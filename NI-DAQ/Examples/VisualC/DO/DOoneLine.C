/*********************************************************************
*
* Example program: 
*    DOoneLine.c
*
* Description: 
*    Outputs digital data from a single digital line
*
* Example Category: 
*    DO
*
* Example Task Types: 
*    1PT, 1CH, IMMED
*
* List of key parameters: 
*    iPort, iLine, iDir
*
*    [Since variables are hardcoded, there is no guarantee that this
*     program will work for your setup.  This example is simply
*     presented as a code snippet of how you can use NI-DAQ functions
*     to perform a task.]
*
* List of NI-DAQ Functions used in this example: 
*    DIG_Line_Config, NIDAQErrorHandler, DIG_Out_Line, NIDAQWaitForKey
*
*    [NOTE: For further details on each NI-DAQ function, please refer
*     to the NI-DAQ On-Line Help (NIDAQPC.HLP).]
*
* Pin Connection Information: 
*    The digital signal will be on port 0, line 0. Connect the ground
*     reference to the 'digital ground' pin.
*
*    [For further I/O connection details, please refer to your hardware
*     User Manual.]
*
*    [For further details on how to run this example, please refer to
*     the NI-DAQ Examples On-Line Help (NIDAQEx.HLP).]
